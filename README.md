Xcode Snippets
==============

It's nice to sync Xcode snippets from different machines and share them with others.

I use [ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin](https://github.com/acoomans/ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin). I really recommend this nice plugin. 

To add any snippet to your Xcode, copy it's contents and set the params from the snippet or as you like.
